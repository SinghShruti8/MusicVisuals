# Music Visualiser Project

# Name: Shruti Singh
# Student Number: D18130610

## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
"Something beautiful to enjoy while listening to music"
The following assignment is an attempt from my end to create some visuals which correspond to music. 
For it, I have chosen an *instrumental music* with varied beats. There are several visual designs which correspond to the music.

*This assignment has been quite a learning experience for me since this module is the one I learnt that I can actually create visuals through code. Initially, I faced quite a lot of challenges in getting the shapes and movements which I wanted, however with the help of last few classes and a bit of researching through google, I have come up with the following result. My aim was to keep it a simple navigation visual design.*

# Instructions
- In order to run the program efficiently, we need to debug/run the program.
- When the visual window - *ShrutisVisual* appears, we need to press the *space key* in order to start the music and the visuals.
- The visuals can be navigated through the number keys 0 to 6.
- The initial visual which is displayed on the screen, correspond to the case 0.


# What I am most proud of in the assignment
A few design cases I like the most in my assignment are - case 2, 4, and 5.
This is because, I really like the fact that case 2 makes the waves look as if they are in 3D despite being in 2D motion. Also, case 4 and 5 have a nice lerped motion along with the colors I have not used in any of my labs before and it actually makes it very beautiful. 

I wanted to create more vertical looking visuals because in the previous labs, we have mostly dealt with simple horizontal waves or a few shapes. Hence, a little different angle of the shapes. Also, I really like the music chosen for the assignment, it has both soft and intense beats, which make the visuals correspond to it even more beautifully.

The assignment and the module has been proved to be extremely learning for me. I hope you like the assignment.
